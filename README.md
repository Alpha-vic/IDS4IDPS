<h4>Integrated Databased System for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camps in Nigeria Using Biometrics 
(Fingerprints And Pictures)</h4>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
Insurgency has become a threat to global peace and security in the 21st century due to 
the fact that it constitutes the highest contributor to humanitarian crises in the form of rise in human casualties,
internally displaced persons (IDPS), refugee debacles, food insecurity and spread of various diseases 
(Emmanuellar I, 2015). In Nigeria the activities of insurgency has caused many communities to have flee
 their homes to various internally displaced persons (IDPS) camps across Nigeria. 
 Recently the internally displaced persons (IDPS) in the camps are experiencing high level of security
  challenges such as kidnappings, stealing, raping and so on, on daily basis which has become a 
  menace to the internally displaced persons (IDPS), Government concerns on how to manage and 
  secure this camps, and difficulty in distribution of relief materials to the internally 
  displaced persons (IDPS) by the donor agencies. The manual method employed in keeping 
  records of the internally displaced persons in the camps has been an issue of great concerns.
</p>
<p>

<p>The IDPS camps all over Nigeria are faced with the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>No proper records of the location of camps/individuals where each person comes from and number of the people in each camp across Nigeria</li>
<li>There is always problems of security challenges ranging from killings, kidnapping, stealing, and other vices because of no proper identification system within the camps</li>
<li>The donor agencies find it very difficult on how and what relieve materials to donate to the IDPS in the camps because of no proper documentation in the camps</li>
</ol>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>
The project seeks to design and implement an <b>Integrated Databased System for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camps in Nigeria</b>
 that captures, processes and stores biometrics data such as fingerprint, pictures, as well as other information on 
 the internally displaced persons (IDPS) and their various camps in Nigeria.
</p>
<p>
Fingerprints are a form of biometric identification which is unique and does not change in one’s lifetime.
</p>
<p>
The biometric data to be collected, when analysed will make it easy for both the Government and 
Non Governmental Organization (NGO’S) to have the identities of the IDPS in the camps, have a clear 
data for statistics for the Government and the NGO’S, and the security of the IDP’S. This project is
 to develop an online integrated database system using fingerprint and picture (images) for the 
 Internally Displaced Person’s (IDPS) camps in Nigeria. It will utilize a portable fingerprint scanner 
 as the input to acquire fingerprint images, a camera to capture picture (images), and a computer
  as the mobile terminal to process the images. Biometrics data such as name, state, local government,
  town, age, sex, and so on will be taken.
</p>

<h3>Aim and Objectives of the study</h3>
<ol>
<li>To design and develop IDPS camps web based record system using fingerprint and picture (image)</li>
<li>To develop a system that will manage identification, verification and matching simultaneously</li>
<li>To compare the efficiency between the proposed system and the manual system</li>
<li>Use the system as a roadmap for <a href="http://nema.gov.ng/" target="_blank" title="National Emergency Management Agency">
    NEMA</a>, Government, and Donor agencies in their planning and policy formulations
</li>
<li>Use the system as a benchmark for research purposes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Significance of the study</h3>
<ol>
<li>Enhance government developmental policies</li>
<li>Enhance high security organization and control in all the camps</li>
<li>Help the donor agencies in their activities</li>
<li>Help government in its economic policies</li>
<li>Help the Bureau for Statistics and National Population in data and information gathering and management</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scope and Limitation</h3>
<p>
This research work is designed to cover all the IDPS camps in Nigeria specially the North East 
using biometric (fingerprint and picture) for identification.
